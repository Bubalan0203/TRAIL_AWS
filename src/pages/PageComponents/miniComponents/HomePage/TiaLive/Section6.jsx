      question: "What is a LIVE TUTOR?",
      answer: "LIVE TUTOR can help students and parents who are worried about their studies because sometimes school teachers, due to a lot of responsibility, are not able to pay proper attention to them. Problems faced by school teachers are that many students study at the same time and teachers are not able to handle them individually. Teachers are not able to pay attention to the needs of each student. The needs of those students whose problems are not solved immediately are forced to face a lot of difficulties in studies later on. That is why most students get distracted from their studies. Due to all these problems, students cannot score good marks on exams. TIA LIVE TUTOR online tuition platforms provide their services all over India."
